# yashlodhi.github.io-TvPlus---UI-Of-A-Movie-Streaming-Website-With-TVMAZE-API

TVPlus is a reponsive front-end for online movies and TV shows streaming website 
created with pure HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javacript and 
the free version of The Movie Database (TMDB) API.

You can interact with the website and search for TV shows and movies from the 
categories on the home page, the sidebar and from the search bar. 
Click on the movie or TV show of your interest and the home page will be updated according to that 
show or movie. 

Some shows and movies don't have a backdrop image and hence a black background will be displayed instead.
Due to rules, the voice for the landing page video will only be played once you have interacted with the website.
In our case, just pause and play the video to play the audio for the video.

If in the future, the TMDB API is no longer free, you can always buy the API key from them and just assign 
the received API key to the API_KEY variable at the first line of the app.js file in the JAVASCRIPT folder.
